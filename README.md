# DDSRNet
DDSRNet (A Deep Model for Denoising and Super-Resolution) is a novel two-stage learning architecture designed for simultaneous image denoising and super-resolution. By decoupling these complex tasks, DDSRNet enables specialized processing for each, leading to more effective noise removal and higher-quality upscaling
